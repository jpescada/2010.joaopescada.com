These are two desktop applications I've designed and developed for touch-screen kiosks, while employed by the <a href="http://www.valedolobo.com/" title="Open Vale do Lobo's website" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/goOut/valedolobo.com']);">Vale do Lobo Resort</a>.<br>
The first is a check-in machine for the Golf Courses, to automate and speed up the process so the players can get ready for their games; and the second a promotional interactive presentation to be displayed in spots outside of the Resort.
